= Hoshi

== Summary

Hoshi is a library for creating real, first-class HTML/XML views.  So,
unlike template libraries, you can take advantage of mixins,
inheritance, and all the other wonderful features of Ruby's object
system.  There is also support for RSS2, CGI, and SVG.

Hoshi is designed to:
	* Generate clean HTML/XHTML/XML with minimal effort
	* Be easy for a coder to use and understand
	* Take full advantage of Ruby's object sytem
	* Be more readable and easier to write than bare HTML

It is semi-modeled after Markaby, but with a much more straightforward
implementation and different semantics (e.g., no instance_eval, so scope
inside a tag works as expected).

See doc/LICENSE for the license, doc/examples for examples.

== Installation

You can install via rubygems,

  gem install hoshi

or by downloading from github (http://github.com/pete/hoshi).

== Usage

These examples and more featured in the fabulous doc/examples directory.
Also, there is a program included called html2hoshi (and associated
lib/html2hoshi.rb; see Hoshi.from_html) that takes HTML as input and
converts it to Ruby code using Hoshi.

=== Class-based

These should be fairly straightforward:

  require 'hoshi'

  class Trivial < Hoshi::View :html5
    def show
      doctype
      html {
        head {
          title "Hello, world!"
          link :rel => 'stylesheet', :href => '/css/hoshi.css'
        }

        body {
          h1 "Hello, world!"
          p "This is a greeting to the world."
        }
      }
      render
    end
  end

  puts Trivial.new.show

You can get a little more complicated:

  require 'hoshi'
  require 'cgi'

  module Layout
    def main_page(t)
      doctype
      html {
        head {
          title t
          script(:type => 'text/javascript') {
            raw "alert(\"Hi, I'm some javascript, I suppose.\");"
          }
        }
        
        body {
          h1 t, :class => 'page_title'

          yield
        }
      }
    end

    def list_page(t)
      main_page(t) {
        ul {
          yield
        }
      }
    end
  end


  class Fibonacci < Hoshi::View :xhtml1
    include Layout

    def list_page(n)
      super("Fibonacci: f(0)..f(#{n})") {
        fib_upto(n).map { |i| li i.to_s }
      }
      CGI.pretty(render)
    end

    private

    def fib_upto n
      a = Array.new(n) 
      
      0.upto(n) { |i|
        a[i] = 
          if i < 2
            1
          else
            a[i - 1] + a[i - 2]
          end
      }

      a
    end
  end

  puts Fibonacci.new.list_page(n)

=== Block-based

For simpler cases where you only intend to produce markup, perhaps for use as a templating engine.

  require 'hoshi'

  str = Hoshi::View::HTML5.build {
    doctype
    html {
      head {
        title "Hello, world!"
        link :rel => 'stylesheet', :href => '/css/hoshi.css'
      }

      body {
        h1 "Hello, world!"
        p "This is a greeting to the world."
      }
    }
  }

  puts str

== Bugs

There needs to be some work done on correcting the tags; I suspect I'm missing
or miscategorizing some of them.

That's the only one likely to affect you.  See doc/TODO for a better list.
